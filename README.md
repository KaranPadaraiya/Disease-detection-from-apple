# Diseased Apple Detection Using Image Processing Techniques

This project focuses on the detection of diseases in apple trees using image processing techniques. It is aimed at helping farmers identify and manage diseases effectively to improve crop yield and quality.

## Overview
The project utilizes image processing algorithms to analyze images of apple leaves and detect signs of diseases such as apple scab, black rot, and powdery mildew. By automating the detection process, farmers can quickly identify diseased plants and take necessary actions to prevent further spread.

## Techniques Used
- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques such as resizing, cropping, and color correction are applied to enhance image quality and improve disease detection accuracy.
- **Feature Extraction**: Various features such as texture, color, and shape are extracted from the images to characterize diseased areas.
- **Classification**: Machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained to classify images into healthy or diseased categories based on extracted features.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of images of apple leaves collected from orchards with known disease outbreaks. The dataset is annotated with labels indicating the presence of various diseases, enabling supervised learning algorithms to be trained effectively.

## Results
The blog post details the results obtained from applying different image processing techniques and classification algorithms to the dataset. It discusses the accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics achieved by each approach and provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each method.
